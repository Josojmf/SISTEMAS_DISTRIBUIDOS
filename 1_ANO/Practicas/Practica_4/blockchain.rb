#	Improved version of "Build your own blockchain from scratch in 20 lines of Ruby!"	
#		from https://github.com/openblockchains/awesome-blockchains/tree/master/blockchain.rb
#  
#   and inspired by
#     Let's Build the Tiniest Blockchain In Less Than 50 Lines of Python by Gerald Nash
#     see https://medium.com/crypto-currently/lets-build-the-tiniest-blockchain-e70965a248b
#
#	Now, Blockchain with prompt transactions, transactions counter for each block, 
#											 ledger, proof of work and dynamic variable name. 
#
#	This Blockchain can be set as a loop for infinite using of the Blockchain.
#
#
#  to run use:
#    $ ruby ./blockchain.rb
#
#
#

require 'digest'    							# For hash checksum digest function SHA256
require 'pp'        							# For pp => pretty printer
# require 'pry'                     # For on the fly debugging
require_relative 'block'					# class Block
require_relative 'transaction'		# method Transactions

LEDGER = []

#####
## Blockchain building, one block at a time.
##  This will create a first block with fake transactions
## 	and then prompt user for transactions informations and set it in a new block.
## 	
## Each block can take multiple transaction
## 	when a user has finish to add transaction, 
##  the block is added to the blockchain and writen in the ledger
